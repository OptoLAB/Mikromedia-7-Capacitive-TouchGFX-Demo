# Mikromedia-7-Capacitive-TouchGFX-Demo
 TouchGFX GUI library ported on Mikromedia 7 Capacitive

## About project

Project demonstrates [TouchGFX GUI](https://support.touchgfx.com/docs/introduction/welcome/) library ported on Mikromedia 7 Capacitive. Library is ported using [partial frame buffers(https://support.touchgfx.com/docs/development/touchgfx-hal-development/scenarios/scenarios-framebuffer-strategies/#partial-frame-buffer) strategy. Project was built using following ecosystem:

 - [mikromedia 7 Capacitive](https://www.mikroe.com/mikromedia-7-capacitive) development board by Mikroelektronika with STM32F767BI ([MCU CARD 23](https://www.mikroe.com/mcu-card-23-for-stm32-stm32f767bi))
 - [STM32CubeIDE 1.3.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) - Integrated Development Environment for STM32 with [STM32CubeMX 5.6.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) initialization code generator by STMicroelectronics
 - [TouchGFX 4.13. Designer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/touchgfxdesigner.html) - graphic software framework optimized for STM32 microcontrollers
 - ST-LINK/V2 - in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM8 and STM32 microcontroller families
